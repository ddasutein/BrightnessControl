# Brightness Control 

Control your display brightness with this program. This program will access the built-in Windows Management Instrumental (WMI) system to set and pull the display brightness value. Note, your display **MUST** support DDC/CI to have the ability to change brightness. Check with your monitor or laptop manufacturer if DDC/CI is supported.
